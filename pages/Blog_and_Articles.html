              <p>Choose a location. Designate and declutter a spot in your home for your workouts. Don't automatically pick your basement or garage. If it's not an appealing space, you won't want to spend a lot of time there.</p>
    
              <p>Look for an area near where you often sit. An empty corner or a spot near your TV, for instance, could be perfect. Seeing your exercise place may inspire you to get up and move. You don't want it to be out of sight, out of mind.</p>
    
              <p>Buy the necessities. You don't need a lot of fancy gear. For under $100, you can buy some basics, such as an exercise mat, stability ball, resistance bands, and a few dumbbells.</p>
    
              <p>Add some comforts. Make a playlist with songs you love. Download an audiobook you're excited about. Queue up a great show on your streaming platform.</p>

                Your heart is a muscle, and it gets stronger and healthier if you lead an active life. It's never too late to start exercising, and you don't have to be an athlete...
              </div>
              <div class="article_hidden2">
                <p>First, think about what you'd like to do and how fit you are.
    
                    What sounds like fun? Would you rather work out on your own, with a trainer, or in a class? Do you want to exercise at home or at a gym?
                    
                    If you want to do something that's harder than what you can do right now, no problem. You can set a goal and build up to it.
                    
                    For example, if you want to run, you might start by walking and then add bursts of jogging into your walks. Gradually start running for longer than you walk.
                    
                    Don't forget to check in with your doctor. They'll make sure you're ready for whatever activity you have in mind and let you know about any limits on what you can do.</p>
      
                <p>How Much Should You Exercise and How Often?
                    Aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity (such as brisk walking). That amounts to about 30 minutes a day at least 5 days a week. If you're just getting started, you can slowly build up to that.
                    
                    In time, you can make your workouts longer or more challenging. Do that gradually, so your body can adjust.
                    
                    When you work out, keep your pace low for a few minutes at the start and end of your workout. That way, you warm up and cool down each time.
                    
                    You don't have to do the same exact thing every time. It's more fun if you change it up.</p>

                <p>On a biological level, exercise improves the things that affect cholesterol. ‚ÄúThe idea here is that yoga can be sort of like aerobics and resistance exercise. Those types of exercises have a very established benefit to cholesterol,‚Äù says Bethany Barone Gibbs, PhD, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who studies the effects of healthy lifestyle behaviors on cardiometabolic disease</p>
      
                <p>Yoga isn't this magic pill that you take, and then you get all these benefits,‚Äù says Sally Sherman, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who researches the effects of yoga on health. But she notes that it leads indirectly to desirable effects. For example, ‚ÄúWe know that yoga improves sleep. And (that) can really act as a pathway for so many other health benefits.‚Äù Many of these benefits, she says, actually show up as things like lowered cholesterol</p>

              <p>Most people feel sad or depressed at times. It‚Äôs a normal reaction to loss or life's challenges. But when intense sadness -- including feeling helpless, hopeless, and worthless -- lasts for many days to weeks and keeps you from living your life, it may be something more than sadness. You could have clinical depression, a treatable medical condition</p>
    
              <p>There‚Äôs no cure for depression. Your symptoms may go away over time, but the condition won‚Äôt.
    
                But with care and treatment, you can reach remission and enjoy a long, healthy life.</p>
    
              <p>A lot of teens feel unhappy or moody. When the sadness lasts for more than 2 weeks and a teen has other symptoms of depression, there may be a problem. Watch for withdrawal from friends and family, a drop in their performance at school, or use of alcohol or drugs. Talk to your doctor and find out if your teen may be depressed. There is effective treatment that can help teens move beyond depression as they grow older.</p>

                <p>Going on a high-protein diet may help you tame your hunger, which could help you lose weight.
    
                    You can try it by adding some extra protein to your meals. Give yourself a week, boosting protein gradually.
                    
                    Remember, calories still count. You'll want to make good choices when you pick your protein</p>
      
                <p>Choose protein sources that are nutrient-rich and lower in saturated fat and calories, such as:
                    <ul><li>Lean meats</li>
                        <li>Seafood</li>

                        <li>Soy</li></ul><br>It's a good idea to change up your protein foods. For instance, you could have salmon or other fish that's rich in omega-3s, beans or lentils that give you fiber as well as protein, walnuts on your salad, or almonds on your oatmeal</p>

                From having occasional difficulty sleeping to insomnia, there is a lot you can do to get a better night's sleep, feel refreshed when you awake, and remain alert throughout the day..

              <div class="article_hidden6">
                <p>We all have a day-night cycle of about 24 hours called the circadian rhythm. It greatly influences when we sleep and the quantity and the quality of our sleep. The more stable and consistent our circadian rhythm is, the better our sleep. This cycle may be altered by the timing of various factors, including naps, bedtime, exercise, and especially exposure to light</p>
      
                <p>Good sleep hygiene can have a tremendous impact upon getting better sleep. You should wake-up feeling refreshed and alert, and you should generally not feel sleepy during the day. If this is not the case, poor sleep hygiene may be the culprit, but it is very important to consider that you may have an unrecognized sleep disorder. Many, many sleep disorders go unrecognized for years, leading to unnecessary suffering, poor quality of life, accidents, and great expense. Since it is clear how critical sound sleep is to your health and well-being, if you are not sleeping well, see your doctor or a sleep specialist.</p>
